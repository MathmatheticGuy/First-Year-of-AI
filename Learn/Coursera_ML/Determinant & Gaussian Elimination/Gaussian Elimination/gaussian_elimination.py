    Solve a linear system represented by an augmented matrix using the Gaussian elimination method.

    Parameters:
    - A (numpy.array): Square matrix of size n x n representing the coefficients of the linear system
    - B (numpy.array): Column matrix of size 1 x n representing the constant terms.

    Returns:
    numpy.array or str: The solution vector if a unique solution exists, or a string indicating the type of solution.
